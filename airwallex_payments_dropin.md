# Airwallex API Instructions

## API Authentication
The user need to provide their demo admin **client-id** and **api-key** to exchange the access token for API calls, which can be generated in the "Developer -> API Keys" page once registered/logged into the Airwallex [Sandbox](https://demo.airwallex.com/signup/sg/sandbox).

To exchange the access token, POST HTTP request to https://api-demo.airwallex.com/api/v1/authentication/login with the headers 'x-client-id' and 'x-api-key' assigned the corresponding values. For example
```bash
url --request POST \
--url 'https://api-demo.airwallex.com/api/v1/authentication/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-client-id: {CLIENT_ID}' \
--header 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}'
```
The `token` will be returned in the response, which can be resued in subsequent API requests (by passing it in the header `Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`).
```json
{
  "expires_at": "2025-08-05T10:53:01+0000",
  "token": "{ACCESS_TOKEN}"
}
```
## Create a Payment Intent
Start collecting payment from your customer by creating a Payment Intent. The payment `amount` and `currency`, as well as the `merchant_order_id` must be provided.
For example
```bash
curl --request POST \
--url 'https://api-demo.airwallex.com/api/v1/pa/payment_intents/create' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

# Airwallex JS Instructions
Airwallex.js is a browser-side JavaScript library that lets you seamlessly embed pre-built UI elements into your web pages. With Airwallex.js, you can enable payment acceptance, customer onboarding (KYC/KYB), payouts, risk management, and moreâ€”all with minimal effort.

This reference provides detailed documentation on every available element, object, and method in Airwallex.js.

## Install Airwallex.js
Install Airwallex.js using your preferred package manager, for example, npm, yarn, or pnpm.
Alternatively with cdn installation, you can add Airwallex.js as a HTML `<script>` tag to the `<head>` element of each HTML page on your site. This installation option allows any newly created Airwallex.js objects to be globally accessible in your client side code.

## Initialize Airwallex.js
Load Airwallex.js and specify the initialization settings and elements you want to fetch using the `init()` function. The modular approach of fetching only the resources specified in `init()` ensures optimized performance and customization tailored to your needs.
> The Airwallex package should only be initialized once in your application.

### init(options?)

# How to build a checkout page with Airwallex API and Drop-In Element
## Step 1 - Create a Payment Intent by API from your server
When the shopper begins the checkout process, you will need to create a Payment Intent to indicate your intent to collect payment from the shopper.

When the checkout page loads, on your server, call `Create a PaymentIntent` with an amount and currency. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious shoppers from being able to alter the payment amount.

Provide `return_url` in `Create a PaymentIntent` if you want to offer redirection-based payment methods (Alipay, Dana, KakaoPay, etc) that redirect shoppers to a partner site. The shopper will be returned to the `return_url` after the payment is complete, whether successful or otherwise.

The PaymentIntentâ€™s `id` and `client_secret` are returned in the response â€” these parameters let you confirm the payment and update card details on the client, without allowing manipulation of sensitive information, like payment amount.

## Step 2 - Add Drop-In Element to your checkout page
First, you will need to import Airwallex.js and then initialize the package.

To embed the Drop-in Element  into your checkout page, create an empty container `div` with a unique id in your payment form. Ensure that the payment form only contains one Element with this unique id. Airwallex inserts an iframe into this `div` on mounting the Element.
```HTML
<div id="dropIn"></div>
```
When the payment form has loaded, call `createElement(type, options)` by specifying the Element type as `dropIn` to create the Element. Ensure that the payment form only contains one Element with `dropIn` id.
```javascript
import { createElement } from '@airwallex/components-sdk';

const element = createElement('dropIn', {
  intent_id: 'replace-with-your-intent-id',
  client_secret: 'replace-with-your-client-secret',
  currency: 'replace-with-your-intent-currency',
});
```
Call `mount()`  with the id of the `div` to mount the Element to the DOM. This builds a payment form with various payment methods. The Element should only be mounted once in a single payment flow.
```javascript
element.mount('dropIn'); // Injects iframe into the Drop-in Element container
```
When the Drop-in Element is mounted a `ready` event is triggered. Listen this event to prepare and load the checkout page.
```javascript
element.on('ready', (event) => {
// Handle event on ready
});
```
## Step 3 - Handle the response
Add `success` and `error` event listeners to handle error and success events received from Airwallex.
```javascript
const element = mount('dropIn');
element.on('success', (event) => {
// Handle event on success
});

element.on('error', (event) => {
// Handle event on error
});
```
If no error occurred, display a message that the payment was successful. If payment fails with an error, display the appropriate message to your shopper so they can take action and try again.
## Step 4 - Retrieve the payment result
Some payment method might redirect the shopper to a provider hosted page. Once the shopper completes or fails the payment, the shopper will be redirected back to the `return_url`, which should be the payment result page of the order. Your server should loop-query the `Retrieve a Payment Intent` API several times for the final status of the corresponding Payment Intent.
